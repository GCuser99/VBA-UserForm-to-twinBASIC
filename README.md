# VBA-UserForm-to-twinBASIC
A simple VBE add-in for converting VBA UserForms for use in twinBASIC

The new and promising twinBASIC IDE and compiler (under develeopment) does not yet support VBA UserForms. It does however have its own native Form designer and associated controls. This simple VBE add-in for Excel converts the state of your UserForm and controls as much as possible into a twinBASIC form into a format that can be imported directly into twinBASIC.

Show a few examples:

MS Forms controls supported:
- Label
- EditBox
- Command Button
- List Box
- Image
- etc, etc

MS Forms controls not yet supported:
- Toggle Button
- Tab Strip
- MultiPage

Things Yet to Do:
- Export Image source from IPicture to format readable to twinBASIC
- etc etc
